TROUBLESHOOTING:
If the game doesn't run, try opening "rubicon.options" in a text editor
and changing "resolution_override" to 1 and "resolution" to whatever
resolution you think might work.

If you run into additional problems, I would appreciate it if you threw
me an email at wickbox@gmail.com or reported it on wickworks.tumblr.com

Changelog:
| v1.2 |
- Fixed the fact that the player's progress no longer saved until a ship/component is bought.
- "Back" button flashes on death.
- Moved choose-ship buttons closer to center of the screen during ship selection.
- Fixed the game forgetting that it changed the resolution via the options menu.
- Tweaked screen size code to make it easier for me to port to Mac/Linux in the future.
| v1.1 |
- Joystick support.
- Tweaked some stats, made everything waaay cheaper to unlock.
- Gaxlid AI fixed; they no longer run off  and hide in the corners.
- You must bank points between missions to have them available to unlock stuff later.
- You now must buy extra lives between missions, instead of having enemies drop them.
- Strafing is now as effective as normal thrust, but afterburners are now 25% better and still only work in the directing the ship is facing.
- Nifty sliding animation whilst choosing your ship.
- Zen mode *actually* gives infinite lives.
- Pressing the close button while in windowed mode now closes the game.
- Blink is now a near-instant teleportation instead of a weird buggy phantom-zone thing.
- Added the Overcharge special ability, which causes weapons to do more damage, fire faster, and have longer range for a short time.
- Other minor bugfixes that I've already forgotten about. (oh thanks a lot, past me. that's real helpful)
